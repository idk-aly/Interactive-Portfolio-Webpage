                    <p>Aims to ensure that all people, regardless of age, have access to quality health services. This goal addresses both communicable and non-communicable diseases. SDG 3 also focuses on vaccination as a preventive measure to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, and aims to lower maternal and child mortality by improving access to safe birthing practices and healthcare services for mothers and children.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, SDG 3 prioritizes mental well-being, recognizing that mental health is just as critical as physical health. This includes efforts to provide mental health services and increase awareness about the importance of mental well-being. The goal emphasizes the need to improve access to quality healthcare across all communities, ensuring that no one is left behind in accessing the care they need.</p>
