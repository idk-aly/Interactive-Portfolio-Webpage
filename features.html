                    <p>SDG 3 seeks to increase life expectancy, reduce preventable deaths, and provide healthier lifestyles for people around the world. It aims to foster a healthier global community, with a focus on prevention, timely healthcare interventions, and comprehensive mental health care systems, to improve the quality of life.</p>

                    <p>It is crucial for individuals to thrive personally and academically, and for students, prioritizing health and well-being enables them to manage the demands of schoolwork, emotions, and problem-solving. Students with a strong foundation in physical and mental health are better equipped to bounce back from illness, stress, or personal struggles and continue their academic pursuits. Students can directly contribute to the goals of SDG 3 by advocating for health, providing an informative discussion of its importance and how to take care of our health, and also volunteering in healthcare project initiatives.</p>
